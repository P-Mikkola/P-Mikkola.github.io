<h2>Education</h2>

* Doctor of Science (Machine Learning), Aalto University, Machine Learning, 2019 – 2024 (expected, defense on March 28, 2024)

<h2>Research</h2>

My research centers around probabilistic machine learning, with a particular emphasis on multi-information source and human-in-the-loop settings. The main areas of focus include normalazing flows, Bayesian optimization, elicitation (knowledge elicitation, prior elicitation, preference learning), and human-AI teaming.<br>

<h2>Related work experience</h2>

* Researcher at the University of Helsinki (9/2023 – present). I am a (postdoctoral) researcher at the University of Helsinki, working with Assoc. Prof. <a href="https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/aklami/">Arto Klami</a> and Asst. Prof. <a href="https://lacerbi.github.io">Luigi Acerbi</a>. Our work focuses on normalizing flows.
* Doctoral candidate at Aalto University (5/2019 – 6/2023). I was a doctoral candidate under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://people.aalto.fi/samuel.kaski">Samuel Kaski</a> in Probabilistic Machine Learning group at Aalto University. My thesis, "Humans as information sources in Bayesian optimization", was submitted to preliminary examination on August 15, 2023.
* Research Intern at the Finnish Centre of Excellence (6/2018 – 8/2018). I studied under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://wiki.helsinki.fi/display/mathphys/Izyurov">Konstantin Izyurov</a> a question concerning a branch of mathematics known as discrete complex analysis. The research was successful in the sense that we found a closed form for a multivalued complex function we were looking for.
* Intern at Statistics Finland (5/2017 – 8/2017)
* Intern at VATT, Institute for Economic Research (5/2016 – 8/2016)
* Teaching assistant at The University of Helsinki (falls 2015, 2016 and 2017)

<h2>Teaching</h2>

In 2021 and 2022, I served as a teaching assistant for the course Kernel Methods in Machine Learning. During this time, I had the privilege of supervising four Bachelor's theses for students Pyry Satama, Sasu Bruns, Marilla Malkki, and Kee Taeyoung. Additionally, I led a course from 2015 to 2017, aimed at aiding new economics students with their mathematical studies. My dedication to teaching was recognized when I was honored as the Social Scientist of the Year 2015 by Kannunvalajat, accompanied by laudatory student feedback stating, "we wouldn't survive without you.

<h2>Community involvement</h2>

I have acted as a reviewer for IEEE TPAMI, AISTATS2022, and AISTATS2023 (awarded top-10% reviewer).
