<h2>Biography</h2>

I am a postdoctoral researcher at University of Helsinki, working with <a href="https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/aklami/">Arto Klami</a> and <a href="https://lacerbi.github.io">Luigi Acerbi</a>. I was a doctoral candidate under the supervision of <a href="https://people.aalto.fi/samuel.kaski">Samuel Kaski</a> in <a href="http://research.cs.aalto.fi/pml">Probabilistic Machine Learning</a> group at Aalto University. I am expected to defend my thesis by the end of this year. <br> 

I have two Master's degrees, one in Mathematics (Stochastics) and one in Economics from the University of Helsinki.

Prior to that, I worked as an intern at various national research institutes (VATT, Statistics Finland, University of Helsinki) and as a data scientist at two start-ups (North Nest Ventures, SkillGrower). I have two Master's degrees, one in Mathematics (Stochastics) and one in Economics from the University of Helsinki. I do consulting for <a href="https://soilwatch.eu">SoilWatch</a> on calibration and uncertainty quantification of soil carbon models.

<h2>Research</h2>
My research centers around Bayesian machine learning and statistics, with a particular emphasis on multi-information source optimization and human-in-the-loop settings. The main areas of focus include Bayesian optimization, elicitation (such as knowledge elicitation, prior elicitation, and preference learning), and human-AI teaming.<br>

<h2>Applications</h2>

The ML methods relevant to my research can be harnessed to incorporate human perspectives into machine learning systems, such as addressing AI alignment issues and designing recommender systems. In addition, Bayesian optimization can be used to solve a broad spectrum of optimization tasks involving diverse and noisy sources of data.

<h2>Community involvement</h2>
I have acted as a reviewer for IEEE TPAMI, AISTATS2022, and AISTATS2023 (awarded top-10% reviewer).
