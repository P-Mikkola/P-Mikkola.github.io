<h2>Biography</h2>
I am a doctoral candidate under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://people.aalto.fi/samuel.kaski">Samuel Kaski</a> in <a href="http://research.cs.aalto.fi/pml">Probabilistic Machine Learning</a> group at Aalto University.<br> 

Before joining the group, I worked as an intern at various national research institutes (VATT, Statistics Finland, CoE in Analysis and Dynamics Research) and as a data scientist at two start-ups (North Nest Ventures, SkillGrower). I have two Master's degrees, one in Mathematics (Stochastics) and one in Economics from the University of Helsinki. In my spare time, I do consulting for <a href="https://soilwatch.eu">SoilWatch</a> on calibration and uncertainty quantification of soil carbon models.

<h2>Research</h2>
My research focuses on probabilistic methods for human-in-the-loop machine learning and multi-information source optimization.<br> 
<u>Research topics</u>: Bayesian optimization, elicitation (knowledge elicitation, prior elicitation, and preference learning), human-AI teaming<br>

<h2>Experience and Applications</h2>
In the course of addressing real-world challenges and conducting research projects, I have utilized a range of machine learning techniques. These include Bayesian inference, deep learning (particularly in the form of deep kernel learning), Gaussian processes, and reinforcement learning. I have worked with various applications, such as developing predictive models for real estate pricing, designing recommendation systems for EdTech products, and implementing preference learning algorithms.

<h2>Community involvement</h2>
I have acted as a reviewer for IEEE TPAMI and AISTATS (awarded top-10% reviewer in 2023).
