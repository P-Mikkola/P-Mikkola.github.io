<h2>Biography</h2>
I am a doctoral candidate under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://people.aalto.fi/samuel.kaski">Samuel Kaski</a> in <a href="http://research.cs.aalto.fi/pml">Probabilistic Machine Learning</a> group at Aalto University. My research focuses on probabilistic methods for human-in-the-loop machine learning and multi-information source optimization.<br> 
<u>Research topics</u>: probabilistic elicitation (knowledge elicitation, prior elicitation, and preference learning), active learning, and Bayesian optimization.


<h2>Theses</h2>
In my mathematics <a href="https://helda.helsinki.fi/handle/10138/330731">M.Sc. thesis</a>, I studied discrete complex power functions on isoradial graphs (a natural setting for discrete complex analysis) under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://wiki.helsinki.fi/display/mathphys/Izyurov">Konstantin Izyurov</a>. In my economics [M.Soc.Sci thesis](files/thesis_econ.pdf), I studied what is the optimal replacement rate for technology-intensive capital. My [B.Soc.Sci thesis](files/bachelor_thesis_econ.pdf) deals with the mathematical formalism of decision-making in economics (and surprisingly it is very relevant to my machine learning research on modelling humans, see [Publications](/publications.md)).


<h2>Community involvement</h2>
I have acted as a reviewer for IEEE TPAMI and AISTATS (awarded top-10% reviewer in 2023).
