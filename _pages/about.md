<h2>Biography</h2>
I am a doctoral candidate under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://people.aalto.fi/samuel.kaski">Samuel Kaski</a> in <a href="http://research.cs.aalto.fi/pml">Probabilistic Machine Learning</a> group at Aalto University. My research focuses on probabilistic methods for human-in-the-loop machine learning and multi-information source optimization.<br> 
<u>Research topics</u>: Bayesian optimization, elicitation (knowledge elicitation, prior elicitation, and preference learning), human-AI teaming<br>

I have two Master's degrees, one in Mathematics (Stochastics) and one in Economics from the University of Helsinki. Before joining the group, I worked as an intern at various national research institutes (VATT, Statistics Finland, CoE in Analysis and Dynamics Research). In my spare time, I do consulting for <a href="https://soilwatch.eu">SoilWatch</a> on calibration and uncertainty quantification of soil carbon models.

<!--<h2>Applications</h2>
I am particularly well-equipped to work on the following applications: optimization problems, sample-efficient and active learning, uncertainty quantification, Bayesian inference for complex models, recommender systems, and user modelling.-->

<h2>Theses</h2>
I am currently finishing my doctoral thesis on machine learning.<br>

In my mathematics <a href="https://helda.helsinki.fi/handle/10138/330731">M.Sc. thesis</a>, I studied discrete complex power functions on isoradial graphs (a natural setting for discrete complex analysis) under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://wiki.helsinki.fi/display/mathphys/Izyurov">Konstantin Izyurov</a>. In my economics [M.Soc.Sci thesis](files/thesis_econ.pdf), I studied what is the optimal replacement rate for technology-intensive capital. My [B.Soc.Sci thesis](files/bachelor_thesis_econ.pdf) deals with the mathematical formalism of decision-making in economics (and surprisingly it's very relevant to my machine learning research on human modelling, see <a href="https://petrus-mikkola.github.io/publications/">Publications</a>).

<h2>Community involvement</h2>
I have acted as a reviewer for IEEE TPAMI and AISTATS (awarded top-10% reviewer in 2023).
