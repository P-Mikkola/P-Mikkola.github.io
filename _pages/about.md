<h2>Biography</h2>

I am an <a href="https://fcai.fi">FCAI</a> postdoctoral researcher at the University of Helsinki, working with <a href="https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/aklami/">Arto Klami</a> and <a href="https://lacerbi.github.io">Luigi Acerbi</a>. I did my PhD at Aalto University under the supervision of <a href="https://people.aalto.fi/samuel.kaski">Samuel Kaski</a>. I have two Master's degrees, one in Mathematics and one in Economics, from the University of Helsinki.

Prior to that, I worked as an intern at various national research institutes (VATT, Statistics Finland, University of Helsinki) and as a data scientist at two start-ups (North Nest Ventures, SkillGrower). I have two Master's degrees, one in Mathematics (Stochastics) and one in Economics from the University of Helsinki. I do consulting for <a href="https://soilwatch.eu">SoilWatch</a> on calibration and uncertainty quantification of soil carbon models.

<h2>Research</h2>
My research centers around probabilistic deep learning, with a particular emphasis on human-in-the-loop settings. The main areas of focus include normalizing flows, Bayesian optimization, and elicitation (knowledge/prior elicitation, preference learning).<br>

<h2>Applications</h2>

The ML methods relevant to my research can be harnessed to incorporate human perspectives into machine learning systems, such as addressing AI alignment issues and designing recommender systems. In addition, Bayesian optimization can be used to solve a broad spectrum of optimization tasks involving diverse and noisy sources of data.

<h2>Community involvement</h2>
I have acted as a reviewer for IEEE TPAMI, UAI, Bayesian Analysis, AISTATS2022, and AISTATS2023 (awarded top-10% reviewer).
