<h2>Theses</h2>
I am currently finishing my doctoral thesis on machine learning.<br>

In my mathematics <a href="https://helda.helsinki.fi/handle/10138/330731">M.Sc. thesis</a>, I studied discrete complex power functions on isoradial graphs (a natural setting for discrete complex analysis) under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://wiki.helsinki.fi/display/mathphys/Izyurov">Konstantin Izyurov</a>. In my economics [M.Soc.Sci thesis](files/thesis_econ.pdf), I studied what is the optimal replacement rate for technology-intensive capital. 
My <a href="files/bachelor_thesis_econ.pdf">B.Soc.Sci thesis</a> deals with the mathematical formalism of decision-making in economics (and surprisingly it's very relevant to my machine learning research on human modelling, see <a href="https://petrus-mikkola.github.io/publications/">Publications</a>).
